## Hi there, I'm Dragos Boston 👋

I’m a software engineer transitioning from production support and developer tooling into backend and cloud-focused roles.

I work primarily with Python and Git, and I’m currently strengthening backend fundamentals through boot.dev (Data Structures & Algorithms in progress).

🔹 Interests: backend development, internal tooling, cloud fundamentals  
🔹 Currently building: Python CLI tools and small game projects  
🔹 Location: Romania (open to remote)

Featured projects:
- Gemini Agent — Python agent with API orchestration
- Python CLI Task Manager — CLI app with persistence and tests
- Asteroids (PyGame) — OOP-focused learning project
